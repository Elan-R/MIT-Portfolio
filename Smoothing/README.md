After finding an error in old code my FRC team had calculating a moving average, I was curious about other ways I could smooth data in real time.  This project is the result of my efforts.  (The FallSmoother is the most interesting)
<br>
While making this project, I ran into multiple setbacks: having trouble implementing the WeightedMASmoother's weights, finding the most succinct logic for the FallSmoother, and linking data structures to maximize performance to name a few.  I solved them by thinking them through, drawing, and experimentation.
